## Troubleshooting:

#### Windows insider:
If you are using the Windows Insider build, please follow this [official guide](https://support.overwolf.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000197893-running-overwolf-on-windows-insider) created by Overwolf.

#### Consoles/Game Streaming:
AlecaFrame will only be able to get your inventory data if Warframe is running in the same PC as AlecaFrame. If you are a console or GeForce Now player, you can still run AlecaFrame, but you will miss out a lot of features that depend on knowing your in-game data.
