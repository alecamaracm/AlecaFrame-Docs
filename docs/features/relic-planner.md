## See relics not owned or other tiers

If you want to see all the relic currently in Warframe, you can uncheck the "Only owned" checkbox in the bottom-right corner of the "Relic planner" tab.

## Squad size

"Selected squad size" means how many people in your squad are running this relic at the same time.

Changing this value will affect the expected platinum/ducats as well as the overall drop rates for at least 1 copy of a drop.
If time-efficiency is the main concern (lowest time to get x), every person in the squad should run the same relic.
If relic-efficiency is the main concern (the relics are valuable, expensive, or unbontainable), only 1 person in the squad should run the relic at the same time.
You should evaluate which strat you prefer and choose accordingly by comparing the expected drop rates and profit for each squad size.

## Exporting current view to the recommendation overlay

If you want to export the current view (filters, search and ordering) to the relic recommendation overlay, you can do so with the arrow icon in the top-right corner.
After this is done, whenever the recommendation overlay open, it will use those fiters to show the best relics to run.
If you want to reset them, just remove all filters and click the arrow icon again.
